	description: "[
		n this task display a substring:
		starting from n characters in and of m length;
		starting from n characters in, up to the end of the string;
		whole string minus last character;
		starting from a known character within the string and of m length;
		starting from a known substring within the string and of m length.
		If the program uses UTF-8 or UTF-16, it must work on any valid Unicode code point, 
		whether in the Basic Multilingual Plane or above it. 
		The program must reference logical characters (code points), 
		not 8-bit code units for UTF-8 or 16-bit code units for UTF-16. 
		Programs for other encodings (such as 8-bit ASCII, or EUC-JP) are not required to handle all Unicode characters.
